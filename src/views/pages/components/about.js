            <p>
            I am a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering 
            at Silliman University. During my studies, I was exposed and trained 
            in all subjects of computer engineering varying from software to hardware. 
            In addition to my academic background, I am a self-motivated person, 
            flexible and able to work in any demanding operational environment.
